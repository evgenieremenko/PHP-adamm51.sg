        <p class="paragraph l">Below are a few report examples from home inspections we have recently completed in Stuart. The first is the electrical panel (breaker panel) from a house originally built in 1938. The Buyers were specifically interested in the condition of the electrical panel and wiring throughout the house.</p><br />
         <p class="paragraph l">The second example shows the condition of a metal roof, which is missing some screws and has some rust (oxidation) around existing screws.</p>
